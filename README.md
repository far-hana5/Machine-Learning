# Machine-Learning
Code and notes from Stanford ML course by Andrew Ng (YouTube version) — Octave + Python



📘 Machine Learning – Stanford University (Andrew Ng)
This repository contains my learning journey through the Stanford Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng, available for free on YouTube. It includes detailed notes, code implementations, and exercises based on the lecture series.

🎓 Course Overview:
The course provides a solid foundation in machine learning, covering both theoretical concepts and practical applications. Topics range from linear models to neural networks and unsupervised learning.

📚 Topics Covered:
Linear Regression

Logistic Regression

Neural Networks

Support Vector Machines

Unsupervised Learning (K-Means, PCA)

Anomaly Detection & Recommender Systems

Regularization & Optimization Techniques

🛠️ Tools & Languages:
Octave / MATLAB (original course exercises)

Python (converted versions of some exercises)

🎯 Goal:
To deeply understand core machine learning concepts and build a strong foundation through Andrew Ng’s world-class teaching and hands-on practice.
